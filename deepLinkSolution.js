To reliably handle deep links even when the app is in the background on Android, consider using a foreground service.  This service will keep your app running and allow it to receive and process deep link intents.  Here's a basic implementation:

```javascript
import * as Linking from 'expo-linking';
import * as TaskManager from 'expo-task-manager';

const DEEP_LINK_TASK = 'DEEP_LINK_TASK';

TaskManager.defineTask(DEEP_LINK_TASK, async ({ data, error }) => {
  if (error) {
    console.error('Error in deep link task:', error);
    return;
  }

  if (data?.url) {
    const url = data.url;
    // Process the deep link here...
    console.log('Deep link received in foreground service:', url);
  }
});

Linking.addEventListener('url', ({ url }) => {
  // Handle url when app is in foreground
  console.log('Deep link received in foreground:', url);
});

// Start the foreground service (ensure proper setup in your app)
// ...
```

**Note:** This solution requires careful handling of the foreground service to avoid battery drain and to comply with Android's background limitations. You should also implement proper error handling and graceful shutdown of the service.
